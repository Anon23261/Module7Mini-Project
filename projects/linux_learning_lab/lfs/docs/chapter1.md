# Chapter 1: Introduction to Linux From Scratch

## Overview
This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of building a Linux system from source code. You'll learn about the build process, toolchain concepts, and the importance of the build order.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the Linux system architecture
- Learn about cross-compilation toolchains
- Grasp the concept of the build environment
- Understand package dependencies

## The Build Process

### 1. Host System Preparation
The host system needs specific packages and libraries to build LFS. Key components:
- Compiler toolchain (GCC)
- Build tools (Make, Autoconf, etc.)
- Development libraries
- Source code management tools

### 2. Cross-Compilation Toolchain
We build a cross-compilation toolchain to:
- Ensure independence from the host system
- Create a clean build environment
- Enable building for different architectures

Components:
1. Binutils (assembler, linker)
2. GCC (compiler)
3. Linux API Headers
4. Glibc (C library)

### 3. Temporary Tools
Basic utilities needed for the build:
- Shell
- File utilities
- Text processing tools
- Build system tools

### 4. Chroot Environment
Benefits of using chroot:
- Isolation from host system
- Clean build environment
- Testing the new system

## Package Management

### Source Packages
Understanding source packages:
- Tarballs (.tar.gz, .tar.xz)
- Patches
- Configuration scripts
- Build scripts

### Build Order
The importance of build order:
1. Each package builds on previous ones
2. Dependencies must be satisfied
3. Circular dependencies must be handled

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Verify Host System
```bash
# Check GCC version
gcc --version

# Check Make version
make --version

# Check development tools
which ld
which bison
which yacc
which gawk
```

### Exercise 2: Create Build Environment
```bash
# Set up directories
sudo mkdir -pv $LFS
sudo mkdir -pv $LFS/{bin,etc,lib,sbin,usr,var}

# Create lfs user
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -g lfs -m -k /dev/null lfs

# Set ownership
sudo chown -v lfs $LFS/{usr,lib,var,etc,bin,sbin,tools,sources}
```

### Exercise 3: Download Source Packages
```bash
# Create sources directory
mkdir -pv $LFS/sources

# Download package list
wget https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/wget-list

# Download packages
wget --input-file=wget-list --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources
```

## Knowledge Check
1. Why do we need a cross-compilation toolchain?
2. What is the purpose of the chroot environment?
3. Why is the build order important?
4. What are the key components of the toolchain?
