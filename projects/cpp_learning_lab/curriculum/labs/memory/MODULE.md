# Module 3: Advanced Memory Management

## Overview
This module explores advanced memory management techniques in systems programming, focusing on custom allocator implementations and memory optimization strategies. Students will learn about different allocation schemes, their trade-offs, and practical implementations.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. Implement custom memory allocators for different use cases
2. Analyze and optimize memory usage patterns
3. Debug memory-related issues in complex systems
4. Design thread-safe memory management solutions
5. Evaluate trade-offs between different allocation strategies

## Prerequisites
- Proficiency in C++17 or later
- Understanding of basic data structures and algorithms
- Familiarity with operating system concepts
